# You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9 only.

# Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

# For example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -> 2 -> 3 represents the number 123.
# Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

# A leaf node is a node with no children.


# Example 1:
# Input: root = [1,2,3]
# Output: 25
# Explanation:
# The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
# The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
# Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.

# Example 2:
# Input: root = [4,9,0,5,1]
# Output: 1026
# Explanation:
# The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
# The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
# The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
# Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.

# Time: O(N)
